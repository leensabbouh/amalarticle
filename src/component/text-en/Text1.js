      <p>'Hiba Alhammadi", from Ar Raqqah Governorate in East Syria, was punished with the termination of her employment contract because of her pregnancy and baby delivery.
Her direct supervisor at a Syrian organization licensed in Germany did not appreciate the fact that she had secured the job while pregnant, and told her upfront that had he known she was pregnant, he would have "refused to hire her" regardless of her competence and despite the fact that he himself interviewed her in the job interview that she succeeded in, consequently started her job.
"Hiba", who works in Ar Raqqah and communicates remotely with the organization to carry out work, says that she had suffered from a medical condition which led to preterm birth a short while after starting her job. So the organization terminated her contract and asked her to spend two unpaid months at home, then come back to work for the same organization with a new employment contract, given that one of the organization's goals, where 'Hiba" works, is to advocate for women's rights. So what about her own rights?
