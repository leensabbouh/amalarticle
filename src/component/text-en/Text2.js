      <p>"Hiba" is one of the many victims of the low level of commitment to the rights of working pregnant women in the organizations of the Syrian civil society where the numbers, which we have collected through a survey of 134 female workers for Syrian societies and organizations, indicate that they are facing a crisis of rights, at the forefront of which is the right to adequate maternity leave. As the Syrian Law, for example, states that the maternity leave shall be 120 days for the first child's birth, 90 days for the second and 75 for the third, whereas 48.4% of the 90 pregnant women surveyed have took only between 7 to 30 days long maternity leave.
