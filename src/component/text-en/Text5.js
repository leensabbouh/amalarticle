        <p>Some organizations practice "negative discrimination" against pregnant women, which shows in different forms such as treating them as if they were sick or incapable of doing their work like before, so they get excluded from some tasks without asking for their opinion or asking them if they could carry on with such tasks. But this alleged thoughtfulness does not take meeting schedules, for example, into consideration, as some of the women we met indicated that the directors chose inconvenient hours to run meetings like in the evenings and outside of working hours, which is a time when a mother should be with her child. Given that most employees in the Syrian civil society organizations are asked to perform tasks after the official working hours.
"Rasha Asayegh" is one of those who were affected by negative discrimination during pregnancy, as she was the director of the coastal region between the years 2012 and 2020 at one of the largest organizations working in Syria, and her work required her to supervise and inspect projects, review plans and reports and run meeting, etc. "Asayegh" says that she was subject to exclusion and marginalization during her pregnancy, that is, a number of tasks and authorities were taken from her without telling her or consulting with her, also, the scope of her geographical responsibilies was narrowed, and the pretext for that was "to take into consideration her medical condition" although she had not defaulted on any of her tasks nor objected to them. In contrast, when the time for baby delivery arrived, her medical condition was not taken into consideration nor was her right provided for by law respected, and she only got one week as maternity leave.
