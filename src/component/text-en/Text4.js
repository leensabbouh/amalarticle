        Although there is an international promotion of natural birth and the avoidance of C-section if not medically necessary, some women still try, as much as they could, to give birth by C-section, not because they like to go under the knife, but in an attempt to get longer leave. This is what happened with "Haneen Asayed" from Efrin who works for a society that is registered in Turkey and active in Northern Syria. "Asayed" says, during our meeting with her, that she and her pregnant colleagues raise their hands in prayer for a delivery by C- section because maternity leave for natural birth does not exceed one week while for a C-section it is 15 days. "Asayed" adds: «I, unfortunately, had to succeed in giving birth by C-section. I got a 15-day leave and I took another 15 days of unpaid leave, then I had to return to work after that»
