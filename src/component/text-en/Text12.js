        <p>The international organizations are committed to granting the Syrian employees, who are directly working for them, maternity leave. But when the issue is related to partner Syrian organizations, donors do not think of the employees' right to motherhood.  While preparing this investigation, a female employee for an organization of the United Nations and another female employee for a Swedish donor organization (both preferred to remain anonymous) acknowledged that they do not ask about maternity leave when they are building partnerships with Syrian local organizations, and they are asked mainly to care for the vision and values of the partner society, their financial policies in detail, employment policy and the policy and procedures of protection.
From this reality standpoint, the suggestions made by the 8 female employees we met in person during the preparation for this investigation had two approaches: the first one headed towards pressuring the funders to guarantee the right to motherhood in the projects they fund and provide budgets for.
The second approach was on the level of local organizations and societies to pressure them into amending their internal regulations so they clearly provide for granting maternity leave and providing internal mechanisms that guarantee full application.
Most importantly, not allowing for this right to be waivered by pregnant women and resorting to the law by filing lawsuits in case they were deprived of this right.
