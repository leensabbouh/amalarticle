        <p>Concealing pregnancy is one of the choices some women make to avoid negative discrimination, suspension from work or any problems that may arise in the way of them trying to have children which is one of their basic rights.
Mais Mahjouba from Latakia says, «During my work with one of the international organizations that has an office in Damascus, I had to hide my pregnancy for the fear of losing my job, since it coincided with a staff reduction process through dismissal or working on half pay. Since announcing pregnancy posed a real threat for me, I worked for 9 months making sure my pregnancy did not show up, and what helped me to accomplish that was carrying out tasks in another governorate so I always made sure that I wore wide and baggy clothes for photos that we put in the reports. I would also ask for the photos to be taken from behind so no one would notice I was pregnant. After the baby delivery, which was very surprising for the organization and was punctuated by a lot of difficulties, I got a 20-day leave that included carrying out a lot of tasks.»
