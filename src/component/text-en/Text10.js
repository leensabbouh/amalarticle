      <p>Upon the absence of clear provisions and clauses, the matter becomes subject to the moodiness of the administrators in the organizations and the personal decision some of them make even when it comes to employing or not employing pregnant women. Some organizations directly ask women if they are pregnant during the job interview, a question that the feminist advocator "Mia Arrahbi" denounces and describes as discriminatory question that is not allowed to be asked at job interviews. She also calls women to file lawsuits against the institutions that ask such a question which aims to exclude pregnant women from the job competition.
For that matter, we have communicated with one of the Syrian organizations mentioned in the interviews, but there was no response on their part.
"Arrahbi" also sees that the absence of accountability in the Syrian civil society sector is one of the main reasons leading to women not getting their maternity leave, in addition to the masculine mentality that dominates the leaders in some of these organizations.
This does not relieve donors of their responsibilities. "Hiba Ezzeddin", the feminist activist and the director of "Equity and Empowerment" Center registered in Turkey, says: «we do not have the financial resources needed to grant 4-month leave as the expenses allocated for employment are precisely specified, as a result, we need a contingency budget so we have discussed this issue with the funders and introduced a proposal to include, in the project budget, a clause that covers gender sensitivity issues like motherhood, and ultimately in case such budget was not utilized, it could be returned to the funder. They definitely welcomed the idea so it aligns with their rhetoric that is supportive of women but the procedures were too complicated.»
Consequently, based on this reality says Hiba: «We came up with an internal solution which is agreeing on giving a 40-day paid maternity leave where the rest of the colleagues take up the tasks originally designated to the female colleague during her absence since we do not have the financial resources to employ a substitute.»
Hiba adds: «I recently gave birth to twins and I only got a paid maternity leave of 40 days interrupted with carrying out some important matters.»
The same issue applies to "Bokra Ahla" Society in Aleppo. The head of the society "Maryana Ali" says: «The major obstacle facing the granting of maternity leave arises from the intermittent funding and the dependence on donors who usually do not fund the salaries of the society workers.»
"Ali" Continues: «Sometimes, there will be enough money in the budget available to cover maternity leave, but when such budget is not available, we grant paid leave of one month while the rest of the colleagues carry out the tasks on behalf of the mother, in addition to the tasks they already have.»
