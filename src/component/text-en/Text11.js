        <p>This problem raises questions about the lawfulness of such procedures and how they are viewed by the Syrian Law which clearly provides for the granting of maternity leave and specifies the duration and details. Similarly, it is the same for the laws in the countries where these organizations were licensed and where maternity leave ranges mostly between 3 to 4 months.
Lawyer "Aref Ashaal" says that the Article 121 of the Syrian Labor Law provides for the granting of maternity leave, and he indicates that this right is international and there are landmark agreements and international treaties signed by most countries of the world regarding this right.
Even those working without an employment contract notarized by the Syrian authorities can benefit from this advantage. Consequently, every organization is obligated to give women such leave according to "Ashaal" who assures that in case it was not granted, a woman can file a lawsuit in court which will grant her right.
Answering a question on the possibility of filing a lawsuit against unregistered organizations, "Ashaal" says that the administrators at such organizations can be sued personally in case the organization was not registered, indicating that the law discards the justification suggesting that the funder does not provide the financial support for the maternity leave, and tries the organization with no consideration thereof.
Regarding the organizations registered outside of Syria and have female employees in Syria, according to Article 20 of the Civil Law, the law of the country that is the shared domicile of the contracting parties shall be applied to contractual obligations, and if they do not share the same domicile, the law of the country where the contract was concluded shall be applicable. If the female employee and the organization have different domiciles, the Syrian Law may be applicable. If both parties are abroad, the law of the country where they are both residents shall be applicable. Here, "Ashaal" confirms that most of the laws of these countries provide for the right to motherhood, consequently, these organizations can be sued where they are licensed.
Whereas the international organizations that have offices in Syria can be sued from inside of Syria according to Ashaal.
