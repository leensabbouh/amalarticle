      <p>Rasha, 30 years old, (preferred to not disclose her full name so she can keep her job) who works at a local branch of an international organization concerned with health, says that the maternity leave at her workplace in Ar Raqqah is limited to only one week, and all women are informed of that when they start the job. She also adds that the women tried to object to the decision and demanded that the leave had to be extended, but the straightforward answer that Rahsa received to these demands during her talks with one of the local directors in the organization was: "we have a lot of pregnant women and we cannot set a precedent for allowing long leave." At the same time, "Rasha" and her female colleagues do not find so many other job options, and this forces them to accept this reality so they do not lose such job opportunity during the current economical circumstances that Syria is witnessing.

      <h2 className="text-center text-[#80298f] my-5 dir-ltr font-bold mx-32">Either these organizations refrain from offering their working women such paid maternity leave that is long enough, or this right becomes restricted to the employees with the stable and long contracts, which are, anyway, small in number in most organizations compared to the number of female project employees in implemented projects of various kinds.
